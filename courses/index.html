    <li> We will, in part, be following the book of Carlson, Muller-Stach, and Peters called "Period Mappings and Period Domains" 
      and Voisin's book "Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry I." Some additional useful references
      are: "Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces" by Rick Miranda, "Algebraic Geometry" by Hartshorne or the online notes by Andreas Gathmann,
      and "Complex Geometry: An Introduction" by Daniel Huybrechts.
